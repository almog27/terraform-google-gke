# GKE Modules

This repo contains a Module for running Kubernetes clusters on [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) using [Google Kubernetes
Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io). 

## Code included in this Module

## What is Kubernetes?

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) is an open source container management system for deploying, scaling, and managing
containerized applications. Kubernetes is built by Google based on their internal proprietary container management
systems (Borg and Omega). Kubernetes provides a cloud agnostic platform to deploy your containerized applications with
built in support for common operational tasks such as replication, autoscaling, self-healing, and rolling deployments.

You can learn more about Kubernetes from [the official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/).


## <a name="how-to-run-applications"></a>How do you run applications on Kubernetes?

There are three different ways you can schedule your application on a Kubernetes cluster. In all three, your application
Docker containers are packaged as a [Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/), which are the
smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, and represent one or more Docker containers that are tightly coupled. Containers
in a Pod share certain elements of the kernel space that are traditionally isolated between containers, such as the
network space (the containers both share an IP and thus the available ports are shared), IPC namespace, and PIDs in some
cases.

Pods are considered to be relatively ephemeral disposable entities in the Kubernetes ecosystem. This is because Pods are
designed to be mobile across the cluster so that you can design a scalable fault tolerant system. As such, Pods are
generally scheduled with
[Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview/#pods-and-controllers) that manage the
lifecycle of a Pod. Using Controllers, you can schedule your Pods as:

- Jobs, which are Pods with a controller that will guarantee the Pods run to completion.
- Deployments behind a Service, which are Pods with a controller that implement lifecycle rules to provide replication
  and self-healing capabilities. Deployments will automatically reprovision failed Pods, or migrate Pods to healthy
  nodes off of failed nodes. A Service constructs a consistent endpoint that can be used to access the Deployment.
- Daemon Sets, which are Pods that are scheduled on all worker nodes. Daemon Sets schedule exactly one instance of a Pod
  on each node. Like Deployments, Daemon Sets will reprovision failed Pods and schedule new ones automatically on
  new nodes that join the cluster.

## Who maintains this Module?

This Module and its Submodules are maintained by [Gruntwork](http://www.gruntwork.io/). If you are looking for help or
commercial support, send an email to
[support@gruntwork.io](mailto:support@gruntwork.io?Subject=GKE%20Module).

Gruntwork can help with:

* Setup, customization, and support for this Module.
* Modules and submodules for other types of infrastructure, such as VPCs, Docker clusters, databases, and continuous
  integration.
* Modules and Submodules that meet compliance requirements, such as HIPAA.
* Consulting & Training on AWS, Terraform, and DevOps.


## How do I contribute to this Module?

Contributions are very welcome! Check out the [Contribution Guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions.


## How is this Module versioned?

This Module follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). You can find each new release, along
with the changelog, in the [Releases Page](../../releases).

During initial development, the major version will be 0 (e.g., `0.x.y`), which indicates the code does not yet have a
stable API. Once we hit `1.0.0`, we will make every effort to maintain a backwards compatible API and use the MAJOR,
MINOR, and PATCH versions on each release to indicate any incompatibilities.
